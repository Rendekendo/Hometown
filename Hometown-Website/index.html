            <h3 id="bestTime">Best Time to Visit</h3>
            <p>The best time to visit Bratislava is during the spring (April to June) and fall (September to October) when the weather is mild and the city is less crowded. Summer (July and August) can be warm and busier, especially with tourists, but it's also the time when outdoor events and festivals take place. Winter (December to February) offers a quieter atmosphere, perfect for those looking to experience Bratislava's Christmas markets and snowy landscapes.</p>
            
            <h3 id="currency">Currency</h3>
            <p>The official currency in Bratislava is the <strong>Euro (€)</strong>. Most businesses, restaurants, and attractions accept credit and debit cards, but it's always a good idea to carry some cash for smaller shops or in case you visit areas that may not accept cards. ATMs are widely available throughout the city, and currency exchange services can be found at major tourist areas, though it’s recommended to avoid exchange offices in high-traffic locations as they may offer less favorable rates.</p>
            
            <h3 id="language">Language</h3>
            <p>The official language of Slovakia is <strong>Slovak</strong>. While Slovak is the most widely spoken language, English is commonly understood, especially in tourist areas, restaurants, and hotels. In addition, many younger Slovaks speak German and Hungarian, given the country's historical connections. Learning a few basic Slovak phrases, such as "Dobrý deň" (Good day) and "Ďakujem" (Thank you), can go a long way in making a positive impression with locals.</p>

Public transport is affordable and efficient, and it’s the easiest way to get around the city. Taxis are also available, but it’s often more convenient to use ride-hailing services like Bolt or Uber for a more reliable fare. The city is also bike-friendly, with dedicated bike lanes and bike-sharing services available.</p>
    
            <h3 id="safety">Safety</h3>
            <p>Bratislava is generally considered a safe city for tourists, with low crime rates. However, like in any major city, it's always wise to stay vigilant, especially in crowded areas or at night. Pickpocketing can occur in busy tourist spots or on public transportation, so keep your belongings secure. Always use official taxi services, and avoid unlicensed cabs.</p>
    
            <h3 id="foodAndDrink">Food and Drink</h3>
            <p>Slovak cuisine is hearty and comforting. Be sure to try traditional dishes such as <strong>bryndzové halušky</strong> (potato dumplings with sheep cheese and bacon), <strong>kapustnica</strong> (sauerkraut soup), and <strong>trdelník</strong> (sweet pastry). For a drink, enjoy a glass of local wine or beer, as Slovakia has a rich brewing tradition. The city's café culture is also thriving, so take some time to relax and enjoy coffee or hot chocolate in one of Bratislava’s charming cafés.</p>
    
            <h3 id="electricity">Electricity and Plug Type</h3>
            <p>Slovakia uses <strong>Type C and Type E</strong> plugs, with a standard voltage of <strong>230V</strong> and frequency of <strong>50Hz</strong>. Be sure to bring a suitable adapter if you're traveling from a country with different plug types.</p>
